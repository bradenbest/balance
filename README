# What is this

  This is a tool I wrote for myself after getting fed up with using separate calculators + vim + a textfile that I wrote as some kind of spartan money-tracker

  It has an uninspired name, but uses no libraries other than the standard library (no dependencies, so compilation is easy-peasy), and was written for a VERY specific purpose with VERY specific data in mind.

  I seriously doubt you could find a use for this unless you need to keep track of:

    * money you are saving, and keeping in a "bank" in your home
    * money in your wallet
    * coins (Quarters, Dimes, Nickels and Pennies, I personally put half-dollars as 50 pennies)
    * clock-in times you are getting from your job, so as to track what your next paycheck will be

  But if you ARE reading this, cause you somehow got a hold of this program, and actually have a use for this, then have a blast! Source code is pretty short (about 400 lines), so I am pretty sure you would have no problem going in and fine-tuning it to your needs

# Configuring

  To configure, edit src/config.h
  After making changes, return to the main directory and re-compile to apply changes

  $ make install

# Compiling without installing 

  not sure why you'd want to do this unless you are testing, but the command is:

  $ make

# Compiling and installing

  $ make install

  Going against convention, the command will both compile and install with no need for root priviledges

# Uninstalling

  $ make uninstall

# Cleaning

  $ make clean

# Running

  $ balance
